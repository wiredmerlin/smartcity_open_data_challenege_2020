Mississauga Smart City Open Data Challenege 2020

Presented analytical insights into the economic status of Mississauga from modelling Census Commuter Flow data. Created an interactive Dashboard with Tableau to present analysis.

Hypothesis:
1. Where do the residents of Mississauga travel to work?

2. Is Mississauga simply a suburb where its residents travel to Toronto or another city for work?

3. Compare the growth of people working in Mississauga from 2011 to 2016 vs other cities like Brampton and Toronto? Does it show a growth in Mississauga's economy?

4. Was there a change in where Mississauga residents commuted for work? Does this impact traffic and greenhouse emissions based on mode of transportation?

Charts:  
Work-To-Residence Ratio Across Major Cities:  
This chart looks at the ratio of residents to their place of work in Mississauga and its neighbouring cities. Mississauga has the highest ratio of residents to place of work compared to any cities.

Top 9 cities Mississauga residents worked in:  
This chart displays the top 9 cities for 2011 and 2016 and in both cases Mississauga has the largest number of workers. This is a good sign as it shows that Mississauga is not just a suburb but its residents choose to work in their own city. It also implies that Mississauga has a resilient economy.

Mississauga residents that worked in the city versus outside the city:  
This chart displays a comparison between the number of people that worked in Mississauga from 2011 to 2016 and the number of people that worked outside the city from 2011 to 2016. There was a 3.7% decrease in the number of people working in the city with a mere 0.04%
increase in people leaving the city.

Cities with increased commute from 2011 to 2016:  
This chart displays the top cities outside of Mississauga that saw more than 50 Mississauga Residents travel to for work.
Oakville saw a substantial increase with 2,265 people travelling for work. Oakville is
accessible via GO Transit but it is very possible that a large number of people are
travelling via personal automobile.

To which cities do most people commute:  
This chart looks at which of Mississauga's neighbouring cities see the most number of people commuting into for work in 2011 and 2016. Toronto is the largest with approximately 1 million people. Mississauga is second with approximately 330,000 people. Which is a great sign for Mississauga's economy.
